      "description": "AMBIENT is a music genre that puts tone and atmosphere over traditional musical structure or rhythm. Basically, it can be anything from abstract noises or sounds of nature, to melodic synths and pianos. You may notice that most of the time it lacks any sort of beat, and that is what makes it unique. \r\nAmbient‚Äôs main goal is to set a certain atmosphere, and to achieve this, the track doesn‚Äôt always have to sound pleasant. Something like the score from Blade Runner can be considered Ambient, too. \r\n\r\nA relaxing, peaceful ambient piano playlist designed to accompany both studies and rest. Soft, beautiful piano passages will become a perfect background for your studying session, helping you to focus and concentrate on the task at hand, making it much easier and less stressful.

      "description": "8 HOURS STUDY LOUNGE MUSIC- Smooth, Chill- for Bar, Restaurant, Spa- Studying, Homework, Essay Writing\nClick Here To Subscribe! ‚ñ∫  http://goo.gl/F8CSkV\nMusic has inspired cultural and economic activities from ancient times to the present day. Music from diverse regions of the world can successfully enhance concentration, memory, mental stamina, the ability to perceive sounds with accuracy and an increased focus on learning. This is an effective strategy for students preparing to take an entrance exam to get into their favorite college or university.\n\nFocus on Learning Music\n\nNeuroscience professionals recently studied these personal experiences by using objective methods to track the effects of early exposure to music and speech processing. The results were published in The Journal of Neuroscience. The studies concluded that studying music at an early age provides a variety of benefits for the brain through an entire lifetime. \n\nBenefits from a Focus on Learning Music\n\nEnjoy a variety of benefits, and study music at the same time. Direct experience is the best way to understand how concentration music can improve mental endurance. Individuals often wonder at this point if there is a difference in the type of music used for the following purposes:\n\n‚Ä¢ Music for studying \n‚Ä¢ Brain power music\n‚Ä¢ Learning music\n‚Ä¢ Music for exam\n\nThe first important consideration involves the musical form itself, and the second consideration involves the background of the individual. All children experience music as an auditory experience, and this is true for written music as well as music with little or no musical notation. \n\nConcentration Music For Studying\n\nFor the purposes of understanding the different elements at play when studying music for concentration, the two primary forms of music available are categorized as either written or oral. However, there is a significant amount of overlap between these two categories. For the purpose of using music to focus on learning, notation is a secondary device used primarily for documenting musical memories. \n\nMusic to Study, and the Studying Playlist\n\nInstrumental music presents unique intellectual challenges, and it demands a high degree of coordination between the eyes, the ears and the hands. It does not take long to study music before obtaining benefits. Vocal music attracts people because the human voice has universal appeal. Selecting the right music to study usually involves listening with concentration to various elements including dynamic range, texture, counterpoint, harmony and rhythm. \n\nResearch on studying music for concentration provides the basis for a school curriculum that helps students to focus on learning math and science by learning music first. The results are impressive. For example, a long study of music can help students get accepted into medical schools.\n\nIt has also been linked to improved performance in the following areas: \n\n‚Ä¢ Increased focus on learning\n‚Ä¢ Pattern recognition\n‚Ä¢ Doing homework\n‚Ä¢ Exam preparation\n‚Ä¢ College math\n‚Ä¢ University applications\n‚Ä¢ Study skills\n\nInstrumental music often relies heavily on musical notation, which is the foundation for abstract thinking and pattern recognition. Many professionals started their careers by enrolling in a program to study music. These successful professionals subsequently perceived the value of studying music for intellectual endurance, and they applied these skills to business writing, problem-solving, computer work and doing homework.\n\nFuture professionals can develop a variety of transferable skills through:\n\n‚Ä¢ Concentration music\n‚Ä¢ Music for studying\n‚Ä¢ Music for exams\n‚Ä¢ Intellectual endurance\n‚Ä¢ Business writing\n‚Ä¢ Problem-solving\n‚Ä¢ Computer work\n‚Ä¢ Research and study skills\n\nDifferent areas of the brain light up and become active during a positive listening experience. This is why the most important consideration when developing a musical playlist is to use a musical style that is received with positive attention. Here is a recommended musical studying playlist that combines different forms of concentration music for studying from around the world:\n\n‚Ä¢ Traditional African drumming patterns\n‚Ä¢ Beethoven violin concerto\n‚Ä¢ Classical Indian ragas\n‚Ä¢ Meditation chants\n‚Ä¢ Chopin piano music\nConcentration Music for Working\nThese musical forms are effective learning tools, but they also generate good results as concentration music for working. Employees who use brain power music on the job experience less fatigue and enjoy a higher morale than employees in workplaces where music is not utilized.\nhttp://youtu.be/PhTjs-R5zfM",

For the purpose of using music to focus on learning, notation is a secondary device used primarily for documenting musical memories. \n\nMusic to Study, and the Studying Playlist\n\nInstrumental music presents unique intellectual challenges, and it demands a high degree of coordination between the eyes, the ears and the hands. It does not take long to study music before obtaining benefits. Vocal music attracts people because the human voice has universal appeal. Selecting the right music to study usually involves listening with concentration to various elements including dynamic range, texture, counterpoint, harmony and rhythm. \n\nResearch on studying music for concentration provides the basis for a school curriculum that helps students to focus on learning math and science by learning music first. The results are impressive. For example, a long study of music can help students get accepted into medical schools.\n\nIt has also been linked to improved performance in the following areas: \n\n‚Ä¢ Increased focus on learning\n‚Ä¢ Pattern recognition\n‚Ä¢ Doing homework\n‚Ä¢ Exam preparation\n‚Ä¢ College math\n‚Ä¢ University applications\n‚Ä¢ Study skills\n\nInstrumental music often relies heavily on musical notation, which is the foundation for abstract thinking and pattern recognition. Many professionals started their careers by enrolling in a program to study music. These successful professionals subsequently perceived the value of studying music for intellectual endurance, and they applied these skills to business writing, problem-solving, computer work and doing homework.\n\nFuture professionals can develop a variety of transferable skills through:\n\n‚Ä¢ Concentration music\n‚Ä¢ Music for studying\n‚Ä¢ Music for exams\n‚Ä¢ Intellectual endurance\n‚Ä¢ Business writing\n‚Ä¢ Problem-solving\n‚Ä¢ Computer work\n‚Ä¢ Research and study skills\n\nDifferent areas of the brain light up and become active during a positive listening experience. This is why the most important consideration when developing a musical playlist is to use a musical style that is received with positive attention. Here is a recommended musical studying playlist that combines different forms of concentration music for studying from around the world:\n\n‚Ä¢ Traditional African drumming patterns\n‚Ä¢ Beethoven violin concerto\n‚Ä¢ Classical Indian ragas\n‚Ä¢ Meditation chants\n‚Ä¢ Chopin piano music\nConcentration Music for Working\nThese musical forms are effective learning tools, but they also generate good results as concentration music for working. Employees who use brain power music on the job experience less fatigue and enjoy a higher morale than employees in workplaces where music is not utilized.\n\n\nDownload: https://gumroad.com/studymusic\nSTUDY MUSIC on Social:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/studyingmusic\nhttps://plus.google.com/+RelaxationClub\nhttps://plus.google.com/communities/109481812357639436161\nhttp://musictostudy.blogspot.com/\nMusic -  Tsutsuji by Chino Yoshio www.chinoyoshio.com\nPicture - photo by hogeasdf on Flickr\nhttp://www.fotopedia.com/items/flickr-4070895215",
